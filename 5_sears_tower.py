# The Sears Tower Problem
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# One morning, you go out and place a dollar bill on the sidewalk
# by the Sears tower. Each day thereafter, you go out with double
# the number of bills as you took the day before.
#
# How long does it take for the stack of bills
# to exceed the height of the tower?
